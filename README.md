to_csv.py
        This file compiles the text documents  into a single csv file of format (File Name, Contents) for easier mainpulation
        
prior_to_model.py
       Preprocessing steps:
         Punctuation
         Lowercase
         stopwords
         commonwords
         lemmatization

        bagofwords(BOW)
       
       
       preprocessing before modelling using K Nearest Neighbour(2)
       
       Chose K-Nearest Neighbour since it is an unsupervised learning technique(Output defined by employment and amendment)

extract.py           
        
        TF-IDF points the relative importance of each word in each document.Hence took that for extracting informative parts of the documents it is  done after the similar pro processing tasks as same as classifier and processed.
        
        
P.S: I haven't completed the assignment to the full extent, but i have the layout or plan to approach this problem if given time I can execute this for sure using even more better approaches for accuracy
